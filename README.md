# CME538 Fall 2023 data_detectives Big Project

## Objective 
* Geospatial analysis of collision counts with respect to traffic signals and street lights – where to implement more lights and traffic signals to improve rider safety
* Analysis of trips made from/to the stations with respect to the capacity of the stations – stations that need to increase capacity

## Background
The [Toronto Parking Authority (TPA)](https://parking.greenp.com/) have initiated a '[Four-Year_Growth-Plan](https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2022/pa/bgrd/backgroundfile-229602.pdf)' in 2022, aiming to accelarate the expansion of Toronto Bike Share servide in the coming four years. The Four-Year-Growth-Plan includes strategies to expand to upwards of 1,000 stations and 10,000 bikes, including 2,000 e-bikes, by 2025. 

As of 2022, Toronto was divided into 140 social planning neighborhoods by the city government. Many of these neighbourhoods have little to no direct access to Bike Share: 
  * 67 neighborhoods with 0 Bike Share Stations. 
  * 1.4 million population with 0 stations.
    
As for cycling infrastructures, Toronto has 1,000 km of cycling infrastructure, but the majority is in downtown area or within parks. Little on-road infrastructure exists outside downtown, making it difficult to cycle between suburban locations quickly and safely.
According to an analysis conducted by WSP, 36 indicators was taken into considerations to determine suitable ‘hotspots’ for implementations of new Bike Share station location. Some of the indicators include: population and employment densities, bikeability (i.e. cycling infrastructure and topography), and transportation mode choice (i.e. mode shares and proximity to significant walking, cycling, and transit routes).
