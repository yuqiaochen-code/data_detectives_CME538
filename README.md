# CME538 Fall 2023 Data Detectives Big Project

## Background
According to [poll conducted by Forum Research in 2017](https://poll.forumresearch.com/m/post/2660/most-believe-roads-safe-for-pedestrians-not-for-cyclists/), 50% of the respondents considered Toronto unsafe for cyclists. Out of those who bikeed to work, 78% considered the city to be unsafe for cyclists.

In 2016, the City of Toronto established a comprehensive action plan, called [Vision Zero Road Safety Plan](https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/streets-parking-transportation/road-safety/vision-zero/vision-zero-dashboard/#:~:text=The%20Vision%20Zero%20Road%20Safety,through%20a%20range%20of%20initiatives.), with the hope to reduce traffic-related fatalities and serious injuries on Toronto Streets. The action plan includes estalishing school safety zones, community safety zones, more traffic signals and pedestrian crosswalks, as well as red light cameras and accessible pedestrian signals. However, according to same poll held by Forum Research, more than half (56%) of the respondents, who were aware of the plan, do not consider the measures effective.

In addition, there are more people (74%) owning bikes in Toronto in 2019, compared to 1999 ([City of Toronto Cycling Study, 2019](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/8f76-2019-Cycling-Public-Option-Survey-City-of-Toronto-Cycling.pdf)). The study also revealed that despite of the measures taken by the city of Toronto, people who were still concerned about safety in general when cycling in the city have been increasing since 1999. Additionally, the presence of bikeing infrastructures on roads affects people's comfort levels cycling around the city. Regarding collisions, 11% of total collisions in 2019 in Toronto were due to dooring (vehicle opening door into cycling path), 6.9% of collisions happened with a car in an intersection, while 6.6% happened with a parked vehicle. 

Based on the exsiting reports and polls, it is imperative that the city of Toronto take actions to improve cyclists safety in the city. Therefore, our group analyzed cyclist [collision data](https://data.torontopolice.on.ca/pages/cyclists) together with other relevant datasets for patterns and trends of serious and fatal collisions involving cyclists from 2018 to 2022 in Toronto. More details regarding the objectives and the datasets are explained in the following sections.

## Objective 
* Temporal analysis of trends and patterns of collisions involving cyclists in Toronto;
* Geospatial exploration of collisions involving cyclists to reveal spatial distributions and correlations in Toronto;
* Analysis of collision patterns concerning Toronto neighborhood characteristics for correlations or trends;
* Analysis of weather conditions to determine instances where collision likelihood increases; and
* Assessment of the relationship between cycling infrastructures and collision occurrences to understand potential influences

## Dataset

* Toronto Collision Map (Excel file): [Toronto Police Service Public Safety Data Portal](https://data.torontopolice.on.ca/pages/cyclists)
* [Toronto Neighbourhoods Map](https://github.com/yuqiaochen-code/data_detectives_CME538/blob/66e05653a912a5a1b7ce3b187a17b586e546442e/toronto_neighbourhoods.shp) Should be transposed before analysis.
* Toronto neighbourhoods profiles data provided by Toronto Open Data portal: [Neighbourhood profiles](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/neighbourhood-profiles/)
  This dataset come from Census of Population held across Canada every 5 years and has data about age and sex, families and households, language, immigration and internal migration, ethnocultural diversity, Aboriginal peoples, housing, education, income, and labour.
* Toronto weather data, obtained from Government of Canada website: [Toronto historial weather data](https://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/daily_data_e.html?StationID=51459)
* [Cycling Network](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/cycling-network/): The Toronto bikeways dataset illustrates the existing cycling network across the city, including both shared and dedicated bikeways
